## Overview

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This is a sample project I made today in order to practice using Next.js and Chakra.

## Features

There is a home page, a page where you can play Nim against an AI, and a page where you can play Sudoku. There is also a feedback form to practice using react-hook-forms with chakra.
